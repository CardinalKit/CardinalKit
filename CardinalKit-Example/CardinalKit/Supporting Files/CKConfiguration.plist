			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>You are invited to participate in a research study on using a new technology to manage high blood pressure (hypertension) at home without requiring clinic visits, using a mobile application and a home blood pressure cuff. You will be asked to record your blood pressure at home twice a week, for a total of 12 weeks, using a blood pressure cuff that will be provided to you, which will then collect and send readings to your doctor. Your doctor may then modify your blood pressure medications, including changing doses or adding new medications, based on your blood pressure readings. You will also be asked to fill out surveys on this technology, which will be de-identified and used for research purposes to improve the technology.</string>

			<string>The purpose of the research study is to evaluate the feasibility of a mobile
technology to manage blood pressure (hypertension) at home without requiring
you to come into a doctor’s office. This involves using a home blood pressure cuff,
direct transmission of readings to your doctor. Your health information will be
used only in the context of your doctor changing your blood pressure medications
based on your home blood pressure readings. You will also fill out surveys on the
technology which will not contain your health information and will be de-identified
and used to improve the technology.</string>
