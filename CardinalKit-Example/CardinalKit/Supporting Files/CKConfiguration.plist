			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>Welcome to TrialX study. Enrollment for cognitive impairment clinical trials, such as Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzhiemer‚Äôs, is time consuming and requires in person meetings which is costly and especially difficult during COVID-19. TrialX&apos;s goal is to provide a digital, simpler way to screen candidates for clinical trials for neuro-degenerative diseases. You would be able to access this consent form in settings at any time.</string>
