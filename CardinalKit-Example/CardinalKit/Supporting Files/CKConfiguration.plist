			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>You are invited to participate in a research study on using a new technology to manage high blood pressure (hypertension) at home without requiring clinic visits, using a mobile application and a home blood pressure cuff. You will be asked to record your blood pressure at home twice a week, for a total of 12 weeks, using a blood pressure cuff that will be provided to you, which will then collect and send readings to your doctor. Your doctor may then modify your blood pressure medications, including changing doses or adding new medications, based on your blood pressure readings. You will also be asked to fill out surveys on this technology, which will be de-identified and used for research purposes to improve the technology.</string>

American Heart Association is providing financial support and/or material for this study.

Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you. 

Any of your survey responses which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries. In some instances, these may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by the Investigators, Stanford University and/or others.  However, participants do not retain any property rights to the materials.  Therefore, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.

If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 

The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals.  However, your identity will not be disclosed.

You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions.

			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>The purpose of the research study is to evaluate the feasibility of a mobile technology to manage blood pressure (hypertension) at home without requiring you to come into a doctor’s office. This involves using a home blood pressure cuff, direct transmission of readings to your doctor. Your health information will be used only in the context of your doctor changing your blood pressure medications based on your home blood pressure readings. You will also fill out surveys on the technology which will not contain your health information and will be de-identified and used to improve the technology.</string>

			<string>Risks and Benefits</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>Although you will use an FDA-approved home blood pressure monitor, there is a risk that the home blood pressure may not be accurate, and you may receive an incorrect medication dose change or new medication. The benefits which may reasonably be expected to result from this study are regular blood pressure management without requiring physical visits to a doctor’s office, minimizing daily life disruptions and costs associated with visiting doctors’ offices for blood pressure measurement or medication changes, and obtaining more regular home blood pressure readings. These may lead to better blood pressure control, which is associated with improved long-term outcomes such as reducing the risk of heart and kidney complications. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment/medical care.

You will receive no reimbursement as payment for your participation. 

All forms of medical diagnosis and treatment – whether routine or experimental – involve some risk of injury. In spite of all precautions, you might develop medical complications from participating in this study. If such complications arise, the Protocol Director and the research study staff will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. In the event that you have an injury or illness that is directly caused by your participation in this study, reimbursement for all related costs of care first will be sought from your insurer, managed care plan, or other benefits program. You will be responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles as required by your insurance.

If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your insurer, managed care plan or other benefits program, you may be responsible for these costs. If you are unable to pay for such costs, the Protocol Director will assist you in applying for supplemental benefits and explain how to apply for patient financial assistance from the hospital.

You do not waive any liability rights for personal injury by signing this form.
